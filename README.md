## Insights and suggestions

## Diversifying Business Focus
Since most of the business is coming from AP (70%), it's crucial to focus on diversifying into other regions like BR and AS. In BR, where all business is currently offline and mainly focused on Car and CV (Commercial Vehicles), consider cross-selling other products like health and two-wheeler insurance to existing customers. Similarly, in AS, implement the vice versa strategy. To boost online sales in BR, invest in digital advertising campaigns. Since there are currently no online sales from this region, digital ads could be an effective way to tap into this market segment.
